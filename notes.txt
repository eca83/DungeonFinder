Dungeon Finders

Main Idea:
- fight professors and ta's to get enough credits to graduate from sfu
- implement for burnaby (surrey and downtown --> possibility to expand later)
- choose your team (faculty)
- number of credits depends on faculty
- different challenges for each faculty (do more research on this)

Intro:
- quests --> complete set of tasks before moving onto next set
- potentially add side quests (go to convo mall to get)
- main quest will direct you to certain location + do something to get prof to show up
- profs will have mini games that you have to beat to get the "credits"
